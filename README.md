# Terra Theme for Visual Studio Code

Terra is a multi-platform color scheme collection, inspired by nature and their seasons, with a day and night variant.

## ðŸš§ &nbsp;Status: Early development &nbsp;ðŸš§</p>

This theme is in an early development phase.

When I am finished with the VSCode variant for the theme, I will continue to work on [Neovim](https://github.com/terra-theme/nvim), Obsidian and [Terminal](https://github.com/terra-theme/terminal) variants.
